# fotoAlbum-e2e

Playwright end-to-end tests for fotoAlbum, run against `backend/` and `frontend/` composed by Docker Compose. Part of the fotoAlbum umbrella; cross-repo rules and decisions live in the umbrella's `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/decisions.md`.

## Commands

- `npm run e2e`: `docker compose up --build --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from e2e`; builds `../backend` and `../frontend` (override with `BACKEND_DIR`, `FRONTEND_DIR`) and runs Playwright in the `e2e` service. Services and image builds use host networking (bridge fails in this sandbox) on ports 3100 and 5273 (`BACKEND_PORT`, `FRONTEND_PORT`); free those ports first
- `npm run up`: builds and starts only backend and frontend, detached and healthy, for trying the web by hand against the backend at `http://localhost:5273`. `npm run down` stops and removes them. Same ports as `e2e`; run `down` before `e2e`
- `npm run lint`: Biome check; `npx biome check --write .` fixes
- `npm run typecheck`: `tsc --noEmit`

A change is done when lint and typecheck pass and `npm run e2e` is green.

## Stack

Node and npm, not Bun: Playwright on Bun is not the supported path. Dependencies are `@playwright/test`, Biome, TypeScript and `@types/node` (for `process.env` in the config). `@playwright/test` is pinned exact and equals the tag of the `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright` image; bump both together. `BASE_URL` sets where the tests point (default `http://localhost:5273`). Add no dependency without asking.

## Happy path only

A new test needs a reason it cannot live in `backend/` or `frontend/`: e2e is slow and brittle, and those repos already cover the red and neutral states. Query by role, never by CSS.
